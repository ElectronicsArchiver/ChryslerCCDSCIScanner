3D printable enclosure.

In "box_top_raw.STL" the LED windows and Reset button hole are removed for easier printing. 

Use 4pcs 2.9x6.5/9.5mm (M3) self tapping sheetmetal screws. The shorter ones fasten the internal LED extender to the top part of the box, the longer ones fasten the box together.

The internal screw holes are intentionally misaligned a little bit to help internal fixture with transparent part slide into place easier.
