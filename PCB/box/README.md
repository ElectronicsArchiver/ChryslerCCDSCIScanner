3D printable enclosure.

In "box_top_raw.STL" the LED windows and Reset button hole are removed for easier printing. 

Use 4pcs 2.9x6.5/9.5mm (M3) self tapping sheetmetal screws. The shorter ones fasten the internal LED extender to the top part of the box, the longer ones fasten the box together.

The internal screw holes are intentionally misaligned a little bit to help internal fixture with transparent part slide into place easier.

Recommended print settings:
* first layer height: 0.3 mm,
* layer height otherwise: 0.2 mm,
* transparent part has 0.3 mm layer height everywhere to help light pass through (thin layers make light scatter so much there's nothing left at the other side),
* print speed: 20 mm/s (first layer), 30 mm/s (otherwise).
* infill: 100%
* support: not needed
